# Javascript Date Time Picker
## Introduction
The first release of JavaScript Date Time Picker was dated November 29 2003 (more than a decade ago). 
It has been free ever since and received lots of positive responses as well as contribution of other developers. 

However, there are much better Javascript Date Picker in the Internet today such as [JQuery Date Picker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker) 
which makes this almost obsolete, even I do not use it on my own project and therefore I do not intend to continue support it.

Having said that, somehow there are developers still appreciate its simplicity and combination of Date and Time selection.
